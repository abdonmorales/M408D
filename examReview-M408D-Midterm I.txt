Review for Exam 1

Go over questions done in past textbooks problems, go over the trig stuff to try and memorize the integration and derivatives of those relative trig functions.

NOTES FROM MARTINES'

U Substitution
7.1: Integration by parts (be sure to know formula, be ready for problems with lnx and inverse trig)
7.2: Integration using trig identities (be sure to know the 6 trig identities and representations for secx, cscx. cotx)
7.3: Trig Substitution (be sure to know the three cases, and you will have to go back to x, remember I like the answer as an algebraic expression when possible)
7.4: Partial Fractions 
7.8: Improper integrals (both types)

9.1: Find constant solution to a differential equation (similar to homework)

       Solve for constants in the solution that satisfy the differential equation (similar to homework)   

9.3: Solve separable differential equations (similar to homework and board problems, be sure to show to break it up dy/dx=f(x)/g(y))

9.5:  Solve DE using Integrating Factor (similar to homework and board problems, be sure to know what to multiply by, you must show how you "undo" the product rule)
