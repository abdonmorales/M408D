This is the second semester of the accelerated calculus sequence. The theory and applications of sequences and infinite series, including those involving functions of one variable, and an introduction to the theory and applications of differential and integral calculus of functions of several variables; subjects include methods of integration, parametric equations, sequences, infinite series, power series, functions of several variables, partial derivatives, and multiple integrals.
